- It's simple, turn devices on/off - or schedule them, we're not going to judge
- Turn on/off devices in someone else's home, they need to tell us you're cool, though
- Yes, we know if you're cool: allow only certain phone numbers to control devices
- Turn devices on/off through voice automated texts
- If texting is too primitive, you can always use our mobile app
